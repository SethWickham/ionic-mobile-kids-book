    <!--The Story Content -->
    <div class="content">
      The Elephant thought to Herself "I'm going to travel back home." It was a
      three day journey and there were sure to be lots of twists and turns along
      the way.
      <p>
        The Elephant came to a <i>raging river.</i> It looked as if it was
        impossible to cross.

        Do you know the <b>middle</b> of the story is where things can seem
        impossible? But don't worry this story is not at the end yet.
